**Cooperation Plan**

 Emily and Christina feel like we are better at CSS and Lacey and Julio feel that they are better at JavaScript, but we all want to get better in our weaker areas. Emily wants to contribute to JavaScript and lend a helping hand with CSS because that is her strength. Lacey likes to prioritize functionality over looks but wants to work on bettering his CSS skills. Christina wants to work on JavaScript as well to better her skills and Julio wants to help make sure we are all feeling included and can help with JavaScript.

**Conflict Plan**

We plan to have patience and understanding of each others skills and also accountability for our own work and how we are interacting with each other. We will make sure we are effectively communicating our thought and feelings with one another to make sure we are staying on track and also that we are open to each others feedback. When approching escalating conflict we will go to whoever directly and offer assistance, ask what is needed and figure out what we all can do to make sure we stay on course.

**Communication Plan**

We will be working class hours and if there are emergencies and we are needing to catch up then we will work on things Friday. Sunday are our days off and if anyone decides they are wanting to work on things then they will communicate that with the group. We will communicate with each other via text or Slack. We will take a 10-15min break every hour. We will ensure everyone's voice is being heard by making sure we agree to communicate our needs. We will create a safe space by being patient and kind to each other.

**Work Plan**

When we figure out what our project will be we will working together building the HTML and then focus on the JavaScript to get things running before tackling CSS.

**Git Process**
We will have a test branch and personal branches that we will each push to the test branch. Then when we all agree on how the test branch looks we will add to main. We will discuss this on Saturdays.
