**Cooperation Plan**

 1.These are the key strengths for each individual. Emily and Christina feel like we are better at CSS and Lacey and Julio feel that they are better at JavaScript, but we all want to get better in our weaker areas.

 2.Emily wants to contribute to JavaScript and lend a helping hand with CSS because that is her strength. Same for Christina and Lacey likes to prioritize functionality over looks but wants to work on bettering his CSS skills. Julio wants to help make sure we are all feeling included and can help with JavaScript as well.

3.Christina and Emily want to strengthen there abilities in JavaScript, Lacey wants to hone his skills in CSS and Julio also wants to have a better styling abilities and his functions in JavaScript.

4.Approaching day to day work we plan on communicating and working on our individual branches and then reviewing each others code to determine what we want to add to main.

**Conflict Plan**

1.When resolving conflict we plan to have patience and understanding of each others skills and also accountability for our own work and how we are interacting with each other.

2.If we feel someone is taking over the project we will address that person and figure out how we can all have a voice in what's being done.

3.When there is a skill level challenge we will make sure we are effectively communicating our thoughts and feelings with one another to make sure we are staying on track and also that we are open to each others feedback.

4.If someone isn't adequately contributing we will also address that person and see if there is anyway we can help them.

5.When approaching escalating conflict we will go to whoever directly and offer assistance, ask what is needed and figure out what we all can do to make sure we stay on course.

**Communication Plan**

1.We will be working class hours and if there are emergencies and we are needing to catch up then we will work on things Friday. Sunday are our days off and if anyone decides they are wanting to work on things then they will communicate that with the group.

2.We will communicate with each other via text or Slack.

3.We will take a 10-15min break every hour.

4.Fridays are extra days we can add if we feel like we are falling behind.

5.After hours we are all available via text and have agreed to respond as soon as we are able.

6.We will ensure everyone's voice is being heard by making sure we agree to communicate our needs.

7.We will create a safe space by being patient and kind to each other.

2.We will be using the GitHub Projects management tool.

3.We will have a test branch and personal branches that we will each push to the test branch. Then when we all agree on how the test branch looks we will add to main. We will discuss this on Saturdays.
